# Air_pollution_Data_Science
In this project I analyzed data on deaths from air pollution each year (From 1990 to 2017) in different countries. In the end I made several machine learning models to predict the number of deaths for the coming years. In this dataset, we have the number of deaths from various causes but I chose to focus only on those from air pollution. In the end I saved the best model.
